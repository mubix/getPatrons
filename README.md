# getPatrons

Basically I needed a way to pull down a list of all the current
patrons. I have done this so that I can start using a service
called Zapier.

Here is the App: https://zapier.com/sign-up/?next=/app/editor/template/15400

Basically what happens is that any new patron, updated patron
or deleted patron gets added/updated/deleted on a Google Sheet
This is awesome but for one caviat. If you already have patrons
you are pretty much out of luck.

I have created 3 Zapier connections (1 for each action add/update/delete)
and I have created this script to get the initial list of patrons
in order to update the Sheet and have it ready for updates from Zapier.

Long story short, now I have a way to keep an updated list of patrons
and at what level in an each to access place. I am doing this in order
to update the credits on Metasploit Minute more regularly
